# Webscape Add-on: The Spider Challenge

## Description
**Webscape** is a board game designed to help players understand the fundamentals of the web. The goal of the game is to escape the web by answering questions about how the web functions. The game includes a game board and cards, but to make it more interactive, I created an **addon** that enhances the experience.

## Features of the Add-on
- **Interactive Gameplay**: The addon activates at the start of each round, adding an exciting twist to the game.
- **Spider Challenge**: At each turn, the player clicks a button on the addon, and an **animated spider** randomly appears on the screen.
- **Timed Question**: The player is then asked a web-related question and has **1 minute** to answer. 
- **Automatic Reset**: After the timer runs out, the game automatically returns to the main screen, ready for the next playerâ€™s turn.

## How It Works
1. At the beginning of each round, the player presses a button in the addon.
2. A spider randomly appears on the screen.
3. A web-related question is displayed for the player.
4. The player has **1 minute** to answer the question.
5. Once the timer runs out, the screen resets to the starting page.

This addon adds an extra layer of fun and engagement to the traditional Webscape board game, making learning about the web an exciting challenge!
